This repository contains example code for the dynamical learning of dynamics using neural networks. The Jupyter notebook creates a network that dynamically learns sinusoidal oscillations with previously unseen period, without changing its weights. See our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02875) for further details and applications. To immediatly run the notebook in your web browser using Colab, click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chklos/dynamical-learning/blob/master/dynlearn.ipynb).

## Prerequisites

The code was written in Python 3.7.2 using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) 1.15.4 and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 3.03.
